"  For the film Last Year at Marienbad, Gabrielle Chanel selected dresses from her collections to create the everyday wardrobe that Alain Resnais wanted for the atmosphere. A bold move for the time. #CHANEL #BiennaleCinema2018 #LastYearAtMarienbad"
"  Gabrielle CHANEL drew from her collections to create a look that evoked the splendour of the 1920s, as well as a modern and timeless elegance. The little black chiffon dress made an impression and immediately became “the Marienbad dress”. #CHANEL #BiennaleCinema2018 #LastYearAtMarienbad"
"  The film is built like a labyrinth and plays with the narrative’s temporal structure, but the dresses help the viewer reconstruct the story’s chronology.  #CHANEL #BiennaleCinema2018 #LastYearAtMarienbad"

"  ""Guided by Karl Lagerfelds vision for the Paris - New York 2018/19 #CHANELMetiersdArt collection, the plumassiers at Lemarié crafted the ornate feather marquetry of this dress over 1000 hours. Each feather was first individually dyed and then hand cut and assembled line-by-line on the finest black organza. #CHANEL @vittoria"""
"  ""In the Desrues ateliers, the scarab beetle was forged into gold buttons and added to this seasons rendition of the iconic #CHANEL tweed suit. As the #CHANELMetiersdArt season’s leitmotif, the scarab punctuated the collection on belt buckles, earrings and minaudières. @vittoria"""
"  Crafted from hundreds of midnight-black feathers, each of them adorned with sumptuous gold leaf, the graphic plumage of this #CHANELMetiersdArt dress glints and sways as the wearer walks. The dazzling featherwork took the artisans at Lemarié in Paris almost 200 hours to complete by hand. #CHANEL @vittoria"

"  Director Sofia Coppola, a loyal friend of the House\xa0for many years, has started an artistic collaboration with CHANEL.\xa0A new chapter\xa0of her creative conversation with Virginie Viard, Artistic Director of Fashion collections, is a video homage to Gabrielle Chanel on the occasion of the upcoming Mademoiselle Privé exhibition in Tokyo. \nThe story of Sofia Coppola and CHANEL began when Karl Lagerfeld offered her an internship working alongside him in the Creation Studio. From this fashion experience, the teenage Sofia Coppola held on to the youthful allure the designer had imbued into CHANEL and has been\xa0a regular guest\xa0at the shows\xa0ever since.\n\n#CHANEL #MademoisellePrive #シャネルマドモアゼルプリヴェ #SofiaCoppola"
  Friend of the House Sofia Coppola discusses the symbols and codes of the CHANEL vocabulary that can still be seen in Gabrielle Chanel’s apartment in Paris.\nLearn more about the creative worlds of CHANEL at the B&C Hall-Tennoz at the Mademoiselle from October 19th to December 1st. \n#CHANEL #MademoisellePrive #シャネルマドモアゼルプリヴェ #SofiaCoppola
"  Filmmaker Sofia Coppola has made a video collage in tribute to Gabrielle Chanel for the occasion of the Mademoiselle Privé exhibition in Tokyo. Composed of images and videos from the archives, advertising and film extracts, this tribute reflects Sofia Coppola’s perspective of CHANEL through her unique style and eye.\nMademoiselle Privé will be held at the B&C Hall-Tennoz in Tokyo, from October 19th to December 1st.\n\n#CHANEL #MademoisellePrive #シャネルマドモアゼルプリヴェ #SofiaCoppola"

"  On the second floor of the Mademoiselle Privé exhibition in Tokyo, the mirrored door opens into Mademoiselle Chanel’s apartment composed of the four rooms in which she worked and received her friends, starting with the white sequence representing the mirrored staircase. \nThe exhibition opens its doors from October 19th to December 1st.\n\n#CHANEL #MademoisellePrive #シャネルマドモアゼルプリヴェ"
"  Passing through one chromatic ambiance to another, the Mademoiselle Privé exhibition brings together all the integral parts of CHANEL’s aesthetic vocabulary. Beige dominated wherever Mademoiselle Chanel settled throughout her life. When she moved into her apartment at 31 rue Cambon in Paris, she covered the large sofa in the salon with a sand coloured suede. \nThe exhibition opens its doors at the B&C Hall-Tennoz in Tokyo from October 19th to December 1st. \n#CHANEL #MademoisellePrive #シャネルマドモアゼルプリヴェ"
"  In her apartment decorated with lacquered Coromandel screens and surrounded by precious objects, Mademoiselle Chanel deployed the aesthetics of her imaginary world. Black is probably the colour that best embodies the visionary choices of Mademoiselle Chanel and is the object of the exhibition’s third sequence — the dining room.\nThe Mademoiselle Privé exhibition opens its doors in Tokyo from October 19th to December 1st.\n\n#CHANEL #MademoisellePrive #シャネルマドモアゼルプリヴェ"
"  Red is present in Gabrielle Chanel’s apartment, expressed here as the colour of Mademoiselle Privé Tokyo’s writing desk sequence. Mademoiselle Chanel loved to dress in red, and each of her runway shows were punctuated with at least one red piece. \nThe exhibition opens its doors in Japan from October 19th to December 1st.\n\n#CHANEL #MademoisellePrive #シャネルマドモアゼルプリヴェ"
"  The final sequence of the Mademoiselle Privé exhibition is dedicated to the colour gold and the fireplace in Gabrielle Chanel’s apartment. Gold was an essential source of her inspiration, from the liturgical objects and the brocaded gowns worn by the clergy in her childhood to her fascination as an adult for the treasures of St Mark’s Basilica in Venice, the Byzantine mosaics of Torcello, the splendours of Baroque art and the Chinese screens. \nThe exhibition opens its doors in Tokyo from October 19th to December 1st.\n\n#CHANEL #MademoisellePrive #シャネルマドモアゼルプリヴェ"

"  When designing the masterpiece of the N°5 Collection, Patrice Leguéreau, Director of the Fine Jewelry Creation Studio, dreamed of an extraordinary diamond to adorn a necklace inspired by the N°5 perfume bottle. A lengthy search by the CHANEL Stone Department sourced a rough diamond, cut by great technical feat into a D Flawless Type Ila 55.55-carat stone. The custom weight of the diamond is the signature of CHANEL, while the shape and proportions emulate the form of the perfume bottle’s stopper and of Paris’ Place Vendôme, from which the stopper was inspired.\n#CHANELHighJewelry #N5Collection #N5\nDiscover more at the link in bio."
"  The CHANEL Stone department sourced a rare diamond for the N°5 Collection, cutting the most exceptional part of the rough diamond with an unprecedented approach to achieve 55.55 carats. This weight was defined by the creative intention of the design rather than the convention which prizes the largest weight above all, a perspective that marks the ethos of CHANEL: an idea holds the greatest value. The finished gemstone is a 55.55-carat emerald-cut D Flawless Type IIa diamond, exceptional in carat, color, clarity and cut.\n#CHANELHighJewelry #N5Collection #N5\nDiscover more at the link in bio."

Elegantly poised at heart of the necklace, like the label on the bottle, sits a D Flawless 55.55-carat diamond. This signature weight was realized through an unprecedented approach: starting with a rough diamond, aiming not for the greatest weight but for the perfection of the stone, cut to the precise dimensions of an idea.\n#CHANELHighJewelry #N5Collection #N5\nDiscover more at the link in bio."
"  On designing the N°5 High Jewelry Collection, Patrice Leguéreau, Director of the Fine Jewelry Creation Studio said, “I didn’t just wish to translate the fragrance, but to write the N°5 story in High Jewelry.” Fittingly, he created a necklace that embodies the characteristics of the N°5 perfume bottle, with a custom-cut 55.55-carat diamond elegantly poised like the label. Four pear-cut DFL Type IIa diamonds totaling 12.47 carats—custom-cut to complement an 8.36-carat pear-cut diamond—suspend from the design like droplets of perfume.
