" Commissioned by Apple. For International Day of Persons with Disabilities, we commissioned photographer Jordan Nicholson to show us what a day in his life looks like. Born with TAR syndrome—which means he was born without the radius bone in his arms—Jordan has found, from a young age, how to appreciate life and the beauty around him. “Early on I realized I was better off embracing the circumstances of my life instead of wishing things were different. My disability made me someone who appreciates all the things that are within reach instead of constantly worrying about the things that aren’t—both figuratively and literally!""\n\nMeet and get inspired by Jordan N. on @apple\n\n#ShotoniPhone 12 by @jordanloves.life\n\nMusic: “Make Me” by @chongthenomad "

" What do you see when no one else is looking?\n\n“For this image, I simply held the phone at eye level using the screen to scope out the landscape and find the best lighting and composition. The key is to always be on the lookout for the perfect composition and use whatever you have available. This spot in La Jolla is most known for bright, colorful susents, but once the sky becomes too cloudy or overcast, everyone heads home. So I wanted to capture this unique and under-appreciated beauty that often goes unnoticed.” #ShotoniPhone by Daniel G. @daniel.galyean "

" Try something new. \n\n“Color is a very important element of photography. It allows me to emphasize the subject matter, especially in minimalistic photos. On a sunny day, try to use light and shade. Block the exposure while hiding in the shadows. The illuminated facade will show its perfect color. You can even gently pull the exposure up on the camera to open up many editing variants.” #ShotoniPhone by Patryk W. @patryk_wikalinski "

" Shooting style is like a good recipe.\n\n“I like to shoot my photos face on, because straight lines are pleasing to the eye. I then try to expose the image correctly by manually adjusting the exposure if needed, so I have plenty to work with when I edit the image.
